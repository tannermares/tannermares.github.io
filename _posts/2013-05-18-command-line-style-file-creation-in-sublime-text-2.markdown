While watching several thoughtbot videos in which VIM is the editor of choice I found myself consistently falling behind whenever the proctor would create a new file in a directory structure that does not exist yet. In vim its as simple as writing the path of where this new file should go. In Sublime Text however, its a very mouse heavy process. Until, the `AdvancedNewFile` plugin! Now file creation is as simple as command line. Check out Nettus+ video below!
